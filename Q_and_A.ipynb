My another observation is that a sum of subsequent linear regression models can be represented as a single regression model as well (adding all intercepts and corresponding coefficients) so I cannot imagine how that could ever improve the model. The last observation is that a linear regression (the most typical approach) is using sum of squared residuals as a loss function - the same one that GB is using."
